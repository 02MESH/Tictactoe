# java-tictactoe-game
This is a tictactoe game created with the Java programming language. This project makes use of convoluted OOP concepts such as Lambda functions, event listeners, and Java GUI libraries such as awt and swing.
Furthermore, the application of a semi-random AI interface was implemented where defensive moves were simulated by using if statements. Offensive moves were then generated randomly.
